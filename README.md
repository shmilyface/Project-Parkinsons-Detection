# Project-Template

A starter kit for data scientists. Use to reference often used code snippets, document models, parameters, resources. Download the zip for a starter kit folder you can use for each new project. Keep work separate!



## About the zip file: 
A basic structured workflow for Data Science Projects


The zip file is a folder to be placed on your DESKTOP. 


The zip file contains the following:


**DATA FOLDER**

Currently contains nothing, should be 
for data files

**FORKED REPO**

Only do this if your file is on the Desktop

Otherwise you might get nested. NO NESTS.

Fork the repo from the Project first, then download it to this file location.

This will help keep your repo updated as well as the teams, and easier to navigate to.


**MODEL**
This should be where the model development happens. 
Additional clarification here for actual model workflow would be helpful. 

**SNIPPETS**
Pre-built functions to help streamline cleaning/exploration/ML/NN aspects. 
Parameter Training Notes

**DS Workflow IPYNB** 
open on Colab or in an ipynb reader. A mix of tips from high-traffic articles and blogs.

**ZIP Template** 
use this as a back up so you can create fresh copies of this file with each new project. Don't forget to update your zip template when you find things you want to add!

**Project Link**
Links to Notion template to help start troubleshooting and organization.
