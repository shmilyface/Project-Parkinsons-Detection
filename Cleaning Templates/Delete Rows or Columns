Deleting rows and columns that don’t fit your analysis is a critical part of data modelling. The df.drop()functions is used to drop rows or columns in a pandas dataframe.  

df.drop('Salary', axis=1)
will drop a column named “salary”. Axis=1 indicates that we are referring to a column and not a row. 

You can also drop columns based on conditions

df.drop[df.name != 'Fia']
will drop a row where the value of ‘name’ is not ‘Fia’
